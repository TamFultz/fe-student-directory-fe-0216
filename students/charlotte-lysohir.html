  I was born in NYC. My senior year of college my mom called me to tell me our favorite slice place was closing and we cried together on the phone. I was prek teacher in Washington, D.C. for three years - two of which were with Teach For America.  Besides my students, the thing I miss most about DC is hearing my name said with a southern drawl.
