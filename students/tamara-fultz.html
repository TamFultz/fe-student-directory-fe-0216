  <div id="hobbies">

    <p>I am an avid reader with extremely eclectic tastes from reading histories of WW1 to feminist authors, such as Terry Castle, to sci fi such as The Expanse series, to detective novels by Elizabeth George. I suppose you could call my cats, Diego and Leon, a "hobby", since they are certainly a time suck. I love tooling around learning stuff like XML, Python, and Ruby.</p>
