<p> Hannah Spencer was raised in the pacific northwest where she was influenced by the trees + water, vibrant music scene and fresh seafood.  She decided to move to Brooklyn last April after placing a bet with her dodgeball teammate (beer may have played a factor). But if Hannah shakes on something, she'll never back down on her promise. She currently spends most of her time on Indesign and Photoshop working as a print designer for west elm. She has a extensive list of New York resturants and bars that she is making her way through, but it keeps getting longer. Hannah will never turn down a concert invite or a chocolate doughnut.
